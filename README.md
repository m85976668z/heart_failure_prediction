# heart_failure_prediction

This project wants to build a prediction model using logistic regression model to predict the death event when heart attack occurs. It involved an interesting comparison between data science and statistics.

# Data source

The data is extracted from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data
I also upload the data, you can download it here: [Data]((https://github.com/m85976668z/heart_failure_prediction/blob/master/heart.csv)

# Some interesting insights from Exploratory Data Analysis

1. Age and ejection fraction are highly correlated to the death event when heart attack occurs. Age and death event are positively correlated, ejection fraction are negatively correlated
2. Dead patients show a higher level of serum creatinine in the blood.
3. Anaemia and high blood pressure can lead to higher mortality rate for heart disease patients, especially when they have both.
